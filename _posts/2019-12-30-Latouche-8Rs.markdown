“The upheavals required to build an autonoous de-growth society can, […] be seen as the systematic and ambitious articulation of eight interdependant changes that reinforce one another. They can all be synthesized into a ‘virtuous circle’ of eight ‘R’s: re-evaluate, reconceptualize, restructure, redistribute, relocalize, reduce, re-use, recycle. These eight interdependant goals can trigger a process of de-growth that will be serene, convivial and sustainable.” p.33

“We live in societies that are based upon the old ‘bourgeois’ values of honour, public service, the transmission of knowledge, ‘a good job well done’, and so on. And yet, ‘It is common knowledge that these values have become laughable… all that matters is the amount of money you have pocketed, no matter how, and the number of times you have been on television’ (Castoriadis 1996:68). To put it slightly differently, the ‘underside’ of the system reveals, in Dominique Belpomme’s words (2007:220), ‘an individualist megalomania, a rejection of morality, a liking for comfort, and egoism’. We can immediately see which values have to be promoted, and which values must take precedence over the dominant values (or absence of values) of the day. Altruism should replace egotism, and unbridled competition should give way to cooperation. The pleasure of leisure and the ethos of play should replace the obsession with work. The importance of social life should take precedence over endless consumerism, the local over the global, autonomy over heteronomy, an appreciation of good craftmanship over productivist efficiency, the rational over the material, and so on.” p.34


“...autonomy has to be understood in the strong and etymological sense of the term (autonomos: He who establishes his own norms’) and as a reaction against the heteronomy of the ‘invisible hand’ of the market, the dictatorship of financial markets and the diktats technoscience issue to (super-)modern society.” p.42

We went to Kings Cross to see Doug Aitken’s exhibition. I thought the work was ok, but not to my taste. The aeolian instrument exhibited outside was completely motionless, even though there was a bit of wind. For me that fact encapsulated my feelings toward the overall show: a bit too ‘style over substance’. Denise gave us a hand out prior to the visit, which we revisited, which I found very interesting.

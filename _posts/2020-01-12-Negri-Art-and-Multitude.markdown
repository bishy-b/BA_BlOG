“Beginning to speak out again means speaking collectively – in other words expressing the value which we have produced and reconquered collectively, wrenching it from the market.” p.39

“Engaging oneself in the at of production – this is the eminent form of speaking out. There is no production without collectivity. There are no words without language. There is no art without production and without language. Art is, above all, this synthesis. Art is the construction of a new language which, first, alludes to a new being; then, when art explodes and the synthesis of language with the new is effected – a new element of life and knowledge – another dimension of ethics has become real. We are Spinozans out and out – we see being as constructing itself through the action of desire, as a continuation of appetitus, of conatus, of the pleasure of living. As a will to potenza. Art is conspicuously the first, but also the fullest and most beautiful of the configurations of this extroardinary movement. Starting from the deconstruction, our work turns, then, towards a collective process of self-valorization, of creating circuits of value and signification that are entirely autonomous, free from the market and definitively aware of the independence of desire.” p.40-41

Negri is talking about the act of producing art as being rooted in the innate energy that people have from the ‘pleasure of living’, which is something that cannot be governed by the whims of the market.

Inspired by my interaction with The Field, I found this essay whilst pursuing writing about alternative economic models. 

“The underlying hypothesis is that squatters, because of their radical politial vision, want to get free from certain forms of capitalist control […]. By doing so, they learn how to satisfy their needs with a great degree of autonomy from the conventional patterns of paying for rent, of needing a paid job, of consuming and spending money.”

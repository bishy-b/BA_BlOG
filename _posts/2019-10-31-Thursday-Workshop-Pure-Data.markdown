Today’s workshop was showing us some of the different possible uses of the contact mics we will build from the kits we received last week. All of the techniques we went through were using Pure Data, and John was using this time to show us how easy to use and how maluable the software is. Currently, most of the aspects of my project that I have been working on are film and music work that don’t require the live capabilities of Pure Data (this is the side of the software that has been focussed on anyway). However, from attempting to create ‘live’ music using instruments when I met up with my collaborators, I realise that I can explore using Pure Data for this.

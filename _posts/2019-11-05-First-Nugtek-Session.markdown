For this weekend the NUGTEK crew organised to meet up in the Lake District to spend time collaborating in person for the first time. This has always been difficult due to the fact we all live in different areas across the UK. I brought an array of microphones with me which we plugged into a hardware sequencer/sampler. We organised by one of us controlling the hardware while the rest of us used a variety of different instruments/techniques with the mis and inputs.

Yesterday evening we had our monthly members meeting at The Field. I was finally able to raise for the first time the idea of holding musical events here. People were all in favour, the only issue that was raised which I was previously unaware of was that years ago there had been gigs at The Field, and they received a number of noise complaints from neighbours. Because of this, other members suggested that it would be better if it were a daytime event and that it were all acoustic. The second one is a bit of a shame, but I wonder if small 10/15w practice amps would be ok?
Anyway, all in all Iâ€™m happy that this is out of the way and event planning can begin!

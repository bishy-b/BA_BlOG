Inspired by Latouche’s moral code of ‘8 R’s’, I have begun experimenting with the idea of recycling when approaching music production. For this, I have acquired a 1000+ file archive from one of my collaborators, made up of half finished tracks, stems and samples he has made over several years. I also have a similar archive, and so I have decided to experiment with a new collaborative method: creating new work solely using these two repositories. So far I am surprised by how enjoyable this has been, and how different and new sounding the final products are.

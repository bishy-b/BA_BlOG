Reading this essay has made me rethink how the structure of NUGTEK should operate. Originally I felt that every decision should be made by consensus, and that everybody involved should have an equal say in all matters. However, this text has made me realise that the key strength we have is trust, due to the strength of our relationships which have been built up between 5-12 years. As it isnâ€™t a big group of loosely acquainted people, but instead more of a tight knit family, we will be able to act on our own impulses a bit more, and take different levels of power over the trajectory of the project at different times.

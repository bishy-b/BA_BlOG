The mastering for the P1 album is finally complete! It took a while, and I’m sure it won’t be as technically proficient as getting a professional engineer to do it, but I am very proud and now feel like I have a much more intimate connection to the music.. priceless

I have also made a few drafts of potential album art for the digital version of the release, which I have sent over to Felix and am awating feedback for.

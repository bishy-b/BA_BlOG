At the beginning of November a number of different problems arose in my personal life in quick succession. Having broken up with my partner of a number of years, I was faced with having nowhere to live. At the same time, I spell of illness (the details of which I wonâ€™t go into..) hit me, rendering me constantly tired, unable to sleep and most consequentially, unable to take my ADHD medication. This period lasted up until late December. I was able to complete some research tasks in this time although nowhere near the amount I would have liked.
